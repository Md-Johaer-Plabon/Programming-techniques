We are given a sequence of N goods of production numbered from 1 to N. Each good has a volume denoted by (Vi). The constraint is that once a good has been completed its volume starts decaying at a fixed percentage (P) per day.
All goods decay at the same rate and further each good take one day to complete. 
We are required to find the order in which the goods should be produced so that the overall volume of goods is maximized.
Example-1: 

Input: 4, 2, 151, 15, 1, 52, 12 and P = 10%
Output: 222.503

Solution: In the optimum sequence of jobs, the total volume of goods left at the end of all jobs is 222.503 

Input: 3, 1, 41, 52, 15, 4, 1, 63, 12 and P = 20%
Output: 145.742

Solution: In the optimum sequence of jobs the total volume of goods left at the end of all jobs is 145.72 

Approach: 
   1.Sort the goods in increasing order accordance to amount. 
   2.Amount of remaining goods after producing all goods = pi(1-r)^timei [i=(1...n) , time = remaining day after producing; timei = (n-1...0)]; where p = amount of good ; r = loss in percentage per day ; n = Number of goods. 
   3.SUm of all remaining goods is the desired output. 
   
 Complexity â€“ 
 time complexity is O( N * log(N) ).
